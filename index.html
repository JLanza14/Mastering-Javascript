/* STAND IN LINE
In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.

Write a function nextInLine which takes an array (arr) and a number (item) as arguments.
Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array.
The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed.

  /* EQUALITY OPERATORS
The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. 
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.
The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means not equal and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa.
The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers.

/* MULTIPLE IDENTICAL OPTIONS IN SWITCH STATEMENTS
If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects
